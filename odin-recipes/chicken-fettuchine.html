    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade chicken fettuccine alfredo is a great dish to perfect at home and has the potential to be better than most restaurant versions. 
    The sauce in this recipe magically comes together in the skillet, coating and clinging to the noodles just right and without the help of flour.</p>
    <p>Heavy cream is gently simmered, reducing and thickening it – and then it gets help from grated Parmesan. The sauce may seem too thin in the pan
        but once the chicken and cooked pasta are tossed with it the dish comes together nicely and the sauce finishes itself. Eat alfredo right away
        and be sure to save a little of the salted pasta water – you can stir splashes of it into the pasta if the sauce gets too thick as it sits.</p>
