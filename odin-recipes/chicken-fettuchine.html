    <h1>Lighter Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade chicken fettuccine alfredo is a great dish to perfect at home and has the potential to be better than most restaurant versions. 
    The sauce in this recipe magically comes together in the skillet, coating and clinging to the noodles just right and without the help of flour.</p>
    <p>Heavy cream is gently simmered, reducing and thickening it – and then it gets help from grated Parmesan. The sauce may seem too thin in the pan
        but once the chicken and cooked pasta are tossed with it the dish comes together nicely and the sauce finishes itself. Eat alfredo right away
        and be sure to save a little of the salted pasta water – you can stir splashes of it into the pasta if the sauce gets too thick as it sits.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
        <li>1 sprig chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat 
            to low; simmer for 5 minutes. Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is 
            cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size slices.</li>
        <li>Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly 
            incorporated; repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm cream mixture is used.</li>
        <li>Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low 
            heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture almost comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until 
            nearly cooked through, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until thick.</li>
        <li>Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</li>
    </ol>
